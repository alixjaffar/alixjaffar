### Hi there 👋

I'm Ali, a second-year Data Science student at the University of Western Ontario. I’m passionate about harnessing the power of data to drive insights and innovation. Whether it’s exploring machine learning techniques, analyzing complex datasets, or creating data-driven applications, I love learning new technologies and applying them in real-world contexts.

In the past, I’ve been involved in various personal and collaborative projects under the “Revan” name, including:
- **Revan Studios** on Roblox
- A custom Discord bot named **Revan**
- The **Revan Hacks** hackathon

Although these projects helped me develop valuable skills, I’m currently focusing on my academic journey and professional growth within the field of data science. Feel free to explore my pinned repositories to see what I’ve been working on. I’m always open to new ideas, collaborations, and opportunities to learn.
